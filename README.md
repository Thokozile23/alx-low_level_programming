**C Programming Concepts - ALX Software Engineering Program**

**Overview**

This covers the fundamental concepts of C programming learned during the ALX software engineering program. These concepts are essential for understanding how to write efficient, maintainable, and error-free C code.

**1. Introduction to C**
C is a general-purpose, high-level programming language known for its efficiency and low-level memory access.
It is widely used for system programming, embedded systems, and applications that require high performance.

**2. Data Types and Variables**
C has a variety of built-in data types, including int, float, char, and double, each used for storing specific types of data.
Variables are used to store data values, and proper type assignment ensures memory is allocated appropriately.
Example:
c
Copy code
int age = 25;
float height = 5.9;
char grade = 'A';

**3. Control Structures**
Conditionals: if, else if, and else statements are used to make decisions based on conditions.
c
Copy code
if (x > 0) {
  // Code for positive numbers
} else {
  // Code for non-positive numbers
}
Loops: for, while, and do-while loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.
c
Copy code
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  printf("%d\n", i);
}

**4. Functions**
Functions in C allow code reuse and modularity.
They can take arguments and return values.
Example:
c
Copy code
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

**5. Arrays and Strings**
Arrays: A collection of elements of the same type, accessed using an index.
c
Copy code
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
Strings: An array of characters ending with a null character (\0).
c
Copy code
char name[] = "ALX";

**6. Pointers**
A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
Understanding pointers is critical for memory management and dynamic memory allocation.
c
Copy code
int num = 10;
int *ptr = &num; // ptr stores the address of num
7. Memory Management
Dynamic memory allocation: Functions like malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free() are used to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically during runtime.
Example:
c
Copy code
int *ptr = (int *)malloc(sizeof(int) * 5);
free(ptr);
8. Structures and Unions
Structures: Used to group different data types together.
c
Copy code
struct Person {
  char name[50];
  int age;
};
Unions: Similar to structures, but they store multiple types in the same memory location, sharing the same space.
9. File I/O
C allows interaction with files through standard input/output functions (fopen(), fclose(), fprintf(), fscanf()).
Example:
c
Copy code
FILE *file = fopen("data.txt", "w");
fprintf(file, "Hello, World!\n");
fclose(file);
10. Error Handling
Error handling is essential for writing robust programs.
Functions like perror() and exit() are used to handle errors and terminate the program.
